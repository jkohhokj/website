# Description

Third migration of my personal website. 

The first was the Dracula theme on GitHub Pages which functioned properly but didn't have any of the quality of life features most web apps have including dynamic features and proper CSS formatting.

The second iteration was also on GitHub Pages but used the HydeJack theme on Jekyll which looked a lot nicer but also stopped working at some point, I have no idea why the Markdown stopped formatting properly. This is also when I got my domain name.

This time I'm running Tailwind CSS on a Vercel app with a lot more knowledge of TypeScript and Markdown extensions so hopefully this will last me a long time.
