# Description

> The Flipper Zero is a multiltool for pentesting over radio protocols, access control systems, hardware, and more.

Through this device I hope to learn a lot about external network pentesting and gaining access for redteaming.

### Firmware 

I chose to run [Xtreme Firmware](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware) because it contained many of the features I wanted to experiment with in addition to many common external plugins already installed.

I am also adding [UberGuidoZ](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper)'s FlipperZero modules such as the Infrared and Sub-GHz databases to allow FlipperZero to interpret more types of signals.
