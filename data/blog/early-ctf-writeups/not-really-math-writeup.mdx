# Not Really Math Writeup

Complete writeup of the "Not Really Math" **algo** challenge from [HSCTF 8](https://ctftime.org/event/1264/).

## Description

> Summary: change the order of operations in a math formula with only addition (a) and multiplication (m) to having addition operations first and mulitplication operations second.

Sample Input:

`2m3a19m2a38m1`

Sample Output:

`1760`

Explanation:

$$2(3+19)(2+38)1 = 1760$$


> Code Concept:
> 
> Add `(` and `)` around the numbers that should be added and change `a` to `+` and `m` to `*`
> 
> Then plug into python calculator to solve

```

    if new[c] not in l and new[c+1] not in l:

        del new[c+1]
        c -= 1
    c += 1

            new[c+1] = "+"
        else:
            new.insert(c-1,"+")
            new.insert(c, new[c+2])
            del new[c+2]
            del new[c+2]
    elif new[c] == "m":
        new[c] = "*"
    c += 1
for x in new:
    if x != "(" and x!= ")" and x!= "+" and x!="*":
        x = int(x)
new = ''.join(new)
print(eval(new)%(pow(2,32)-1))
