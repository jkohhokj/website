    description: `Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining **robust**, **optimal** and **reusable** software that has no hidden control flow, no hidden memory allocations, and no preprocessor.
    Like C, Zig does not handle garbage collection and instead uses allocators to manage memory. Additionally, Zig is backwards compatible with C and people have been speculating that it will replace Zig on embedded systems.
    I hope that by learn Zig I'll be able to learn low-level computer systems without worrying about unnecessarily fickle memory mistakes.`,
